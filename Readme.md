# Tome Wiki

Tome is an attempt to create a git-backed wiki that is slim, trivial to deploy, looks clean, and is written as a modern
web application. It's core features are:

* Self contained (no external dependencies, like a database, or index service)
* Built in search
* `git` backed
* Revision history
* 3-way merge resolution
* Syntax-highlighted editor
* Markdown syntax
* Mobile support
* Persona-backed user system
* Comments (a la Google Docs) [Maybe.]
* File uploads

## Current Status

The following items are left:

* Ability to edit
* `git` backed
* Revision history
* 3-way merge resolution
* Syntax-highlighted editor
* Persona-backed user system
* Comments (a la Google Docs) [Maybe.]
* File uploads
