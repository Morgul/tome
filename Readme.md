# Tome Wiki

Tome is an attempt to create a git-backed wiki that is slim, trivial to deploy, looks clean, and is written as a modern
web application. It's core features are:

* Self contained (no external dependencies, like a database, or index service)
* Built in search
* Revision history
* Markdown syntax
* Mobile support

In addition, it also support the following extras:

* Persona-backed user system
* Comments (a la Google Docs)
* File uploads
