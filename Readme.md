# Tome Wiki

Tome is an attempt to create a wiki that is slim, trivial to deploy, looks clean, and is written as a modern
web application. It's core features are:

* Built in search
* Revision history
* Ability to diff page revisions
* 3-way merge resolution
* Syntax-highlighted editor
* Markdown syntax
* Mobile support
* Persona-backed user system
* Comments
* File uploads

## Current Status

Right now I'm closing in on my first preview release.

The following items are left:

* 3-way merge resolution
* Ability to diff page revisions
* Comments (Not sure how I want to design these)
* File uploads

## Installing

TBD.

## Customizing

TBD.

## Testing

TBD.
